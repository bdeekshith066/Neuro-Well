NeuroWell  

- Neurons → Neurons are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, responsible for transmitting information throughout the body.  
- Well-being → Enabling a healthier, independent life for stroke survivors.  

NeuroWell is an advanced neuro-rehabilitation platform designed to revolutionize stroke diagnosis and recovery.
With over 15 million people worldwide experiencing strokes annually—resulting in 5 million deaths and another 5 million facing permanent disability—early intervention and precise rehabilitation are crucial. 
Traditional rehabilitation methods often lack personalized treatment plans and objective progress tracking, leaving many stroke survivors struggling with incomplete recovery.  

NeuroWell bridges this gap by integrating AI-driven assessments, computer vision, and speech analysis to provide real-time evaluations of cognitive, motor, and speech impairments.
By leveraging cutting-edge technology, the platform offers personalized rehabilitation strategies based on a patient’s unique needs, helping to optimize recovery and enhance quality of life.  


Key Statistics & Impact  
- Stroke Recovery Rates  
-- 10 percent of stroke survivors recover almost completely.  
-- 25 percent recover with minor impairments.  
-- 40 percent experience moderate to severe impairments requiring specialized care.  
-- 15 percent require long-term care in a rehabilitation facility.  

- Motor Function Impairments  
-- 75 percent of stroke survivors experience lasting motor deficits.  
-- Hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body) affects 50 percent of stroke patients.  
-- Hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body) impacts daily mobility and independence.  

- Cognitive and Speech Challenges  
-- Aphasia affects 30 to 40 percent of stroke patients, impairing speech production and comprehension.  
-- Post-stroke cognitive impairment occurs in 30 percent of survivors, affecting memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities.  

Vision & Sensory Impairments  
Strokes affecting the occipital lobe can lead to blindness, double vision, or visual field loss.  
Up to 65 percent of stroke survivors report sensory deficits, such as numbness or abnormal sensations.
